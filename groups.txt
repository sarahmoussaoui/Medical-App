i want to develop a python app interface that has a part for a text editor and a part of multiple buttons, cltr Z must be enables.
you need to understand that by clicking on a button a dropdown menu of possible phrases appears, by clicking on a choice of the dropdown of possible
displays , the chosen phrase appears on the text editor, the dropdown menu shows the beginning of the phrase only.
